# To-Do [Renamer]

## Packages to Install

## Steps

- Set max numberof files to be processed at 200.

- Style.

## Nice to Have

- Generate video thumbnail (.gif) for found files.

  - Thumbnails will be stored in a directory within the app.
  - This directory will need to be cleaned on each run to remove old/unneeded thumbnails.

- Small Icon for multi files container, when hovered show help tool-top to identify how to copy files in from Excel.

## Bugs

- When reverting files, the message saying 'Revert Complete' (in modal), appears before all files have actually been reverted.

- Possibly, still not always deleted parent folder (on Mac) after reverting.
